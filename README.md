Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

This project allows a user to change their profile, to select photos.

I created this project with JavaScript, HTML, & CSS.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
